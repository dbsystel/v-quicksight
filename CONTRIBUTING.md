## Getting started <!-- omit in toc -->

Before you begin:

- This site is powered by Node.js. Check to see if you're on the [version of node we support](contributing/development.md).
- Have you read the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)?
- Check out the [existing issues](https://github.com/dbsystel/v-quicksight/issues).

## Don't see your issue? Open one

If you spot something new, open an issue using a [template](https://github.com/dbsystel/v-quicksight/issues/new/choose).
We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix.

## Ready to make a change? Fork the repo

Fork using GitHub Desktop:

- [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop.
- Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!

Fork using the command line:

- [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.

Fork with [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces):

- [Fork, edit, and preview](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/creating-a-codespace) using [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) without having to install and run the project locally.

## Make your update

Make your changes to the file(s) you'd like to update.
Please be sure to update the documentation as well, when adding new features or changing the API.

## Open a pull request

When you're done making changes and you'd like to propose them for review, open your PR (pull request).

## Submit your PR & get it reviewed

- Once you submit your PR, others from the community will review it with you.
- After that, we may have questions, check back on your PR to keep up with the conversation.
- Did you have an issue, like a merge conflict? Check out our [git tutorial](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/managing-merge-conflicts) on how to resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

## Self review

You should always review your own PR first.

For content changes, make sure that you:

- [ ] Confirm that the changes meet the user experience and goals outlined in the content design plan (if there is one).
- [ ] Compare your pull request's source changes to staging to confirm that the output matches the source and that everything is rendering as expected.
- [ ] This helps spot issues like typos, content that doesn't follow the style guide, or content that isn't rendering due to versioning problems.
- [ ] Remember that lists and tables can be tricky.
- [ ] Review the content for technical accuracy.
- [ ] Copy-edit the changes for grammar, spelling, and adherence.
- [ ] If there are any failing checks in your PR, troubleshoot them until they're all passing.

## Reviewing

We review every single PR. The purpose of reviews is to create the best content we can for people who use this library.

:yellow_heart: Reviews are always respectful, acknowledging that everyone did the best possible job with the knowledge they had at the time.
:yellow_heart: Reviews discuss content, not the person who created it.
:yellow_heart: Reviews are constructive and start conversation around feedback.

## Suggested changes

We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments.
You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.

As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
